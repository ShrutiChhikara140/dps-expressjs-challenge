# DPS Backend Coding Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains a very basic web application based on Typescript and Express.js. Main application file is `index.ts`. Node and npm are required.

## Environment Setup

Ensure you have Node.js (v14.x or later) and npm (v6.x or later) installed.  
To set up and run the application, execute the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will then be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Context

You will develop a backend system for managing data about a company's projects and their associated reports. Each project may have multiple reports linked to it, though having reports is not mandatory. Start your implementation using the provided SQLite database([db/db.sqlite3](./db/db.sqlite3)).

Refer to the database schema provided for understanding the data structure ðŸ‘‡

NOTE: You can use ([db.service.ts](./src/services/db.service.ts)) to handle SQL queries to the database.

## Challenge Submission 

This project is a RESTful API built with ExpressJS and SQLite, providing functionality to manage and process reports in a database. The project contains various endpoints to fetch, filter, and process reports based on different criteria.

## API Documentation
This section outlines the CRUD operations for managing projects and reports, including detailed descriptions of each API call, input parameters, output responses, and database changes.
